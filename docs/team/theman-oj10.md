### Project: CareerSync

Given below are my contributions to the project.
- **New Feature**: Added sort functionality to the list of internships.
  - What it does: allows the user to sort the list of internships by title, company name, or application status.
  - Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it allows the user to view the list of internships in a more organized manner.
  - Highlights: This enhancement required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to the existing codebase.
