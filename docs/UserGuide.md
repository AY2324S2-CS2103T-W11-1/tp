<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-success">

üí° **Try It Out:**<br>

Key in the following command in the CLI: `exit`<br>

Upon reopening the app:<br>
![After successfully reopening](./images/tutorial/reopen.png)<br>
You now see all your internships that you have when you exited. Your data was saved!
</div>

#### Must-Know: What Makes An Internship Unique

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-danger">
‚ö†Ô∏è **BEFORE YOU BEGIN!** 
<br>

A crucial concept to understand when using the application is to understand <br> **What Makes An Internship Unique**<br>

This will help you avoid confusion when creating internship entries and avoid creating duplicates! <br>

<br> The following is what makes an internship unique: <br>
**Company Name** <br>
**Contact Name** <br>
**Contact Email** <br>
**Contact Number** <br>
**Description** <br>
**Role** <br>
**Location** <br>

<br> In other words, an internship entry is considered a duplicate, if **all of the above fields** for the current 
internship entry and an already existing internship entry **are the same**!

</div>

  * 'withall' returns internships that match each prefix-keyword predicate.
    * Within each prefix field that you specified, the internship just has to contain any of the keywords.
  * 'withany' returns internships that match at least one prefix-keyword predicate.
* The search is case-insensitive. e.g `google` will match `Google`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Microsoft Google` will match `Google Microsoft`
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Goo` will not match `Google`
* Internship matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).

## **Miscellaneous**
### FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Do the following steps: <br> 1. Navigate to the folder where CareerSync.jar is stored. <br> 2. Copy your data file from data/internshipdata.json. <br> 3. Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file (data/internshipdata.json) it creates with the file that contains the data (JSON file) of your previous CareerSync home folder.

### Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen.<br>
**The solution** is to delete the `preferences.json` file from the folder where you installed the application. Then, run the application again.
