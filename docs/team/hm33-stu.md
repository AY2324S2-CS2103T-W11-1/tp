### Project: CareerSync

Given below are my contributions to the project.
- **New Feature**: Created Optional Fields Functionality.
    - What it does: Allows the user to not have to enter all fields when creating an internship entry.
    - Justification: Enables the user to add internships on-the-go.
    - Highlights: This feature went through a series of changes to implementation. Key change was from accepting NULL/blank values to using default values.

- **New Feature**: Documentation, Deadlines and Deliverables
