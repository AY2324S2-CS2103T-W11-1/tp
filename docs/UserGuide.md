<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**Notes about the command format**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add /com COMPANY_NAME`, `COMPANY_NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add /com Google`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `/com COMPANY_NAME [/poc NAME_OF_CONTACT]` can be used as `/com Alibaba /poc Jack Ma` or as `/com Alibaba`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `/com COMPANY_NAME /desc DESCRIPTION`, `/desc DESCRIPTION /com COMPANY_NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines

### Saving and Editing Your Internship Data

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-danger">

⚠️ Caution:
Users are **NOT** recommended to modify their data file directly, since wrong formatting will cause the app to malfunction.
Only do so if you are an experienced user! <br>
</div>

CareerSync data is saved in the hard disk, as a JSON file at the path `[JAR file location]/data/internship.json`.
After every command that changes the data, CareerSync performs a save automatically. There is no need to save manually.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous CareerSync home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen.<br>
**The solution** is to delete the `preferences.json` file from the folder where you installed the application. Then, run the application again.
